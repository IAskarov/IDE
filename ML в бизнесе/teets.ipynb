    "Предложите механизм сортировки комментариев к постам по их популярности на основе методов\n",

    "\n",
    "Для этого:\n",
    "1. Проведите проверку и разведочный анализ данных (EDA) и подумайте, какие готовые решения можно использовать для представления текста.\n",
    "2. Используя тренировочную и тестовую выборки датасета, обучите модель ранжировать текстовые комментарии в порядке их популярности (от популярных к менее популярным) и проведите валидацию своей модели. Выбор модели необходимо аргументировать, основываясь на результатах обучения.\n",
    "3. Проанализируйте полученные результаты и сформулируйте полезные инсайты о том, что обычно содержит популярный комментарий, чтобы команда VK могла использовать эту информацию для улучшения комментариев своих пользователей.\n",
    "4. Предложите методы взаимодействия с комментаторами, а также механизмы поддержки для разных групп пользователей, включая тех, чьи комментарии непопулярны."

The conventional wisdom before the iPhone was that native apps were all but dead anyway, and the browser was the future. The iPhone's App Store and attendant restrictions singlehandedly revived the concept of consumers installing software. Meanwhile, the Mac is gaining enough market share that it's now clearly a target for malware. Code signing is about as open as you can get while still tamping down nasty code (and let me stress again that GateKeeper is way more freeform than anything on iOS).If there are alternate solutions to these issues, it would be fascinating to hear them.

The conventional wisdom before the iPhone was that native apps were all but dead anyway, and the browser was the future. The iPhone's App Store and attendant restrictions singlehandedly revived the concept of consumers installing software. Meanwhile, the Mac is gaining enough market share that it's now clearly a target for malware. Code signing is about as open as you can get while still tamping down nasty code (and let me stress again that GateKeeper is way more freeform than anything on iOS).If there are alternate solutions to these issues, it would be fascinating to hear them.

Some founders go back to school and keep working on the startup while there.  However, those do so much worse than the people who work on the startup full-time that going back to school seems, in practice, not too far removed from a death sentence for a startup.Off the top of my head, I'd guess we've had about 8 startups where the founders went back to school.  It doesn't only happen with summer batches.  Founders from winter batches do it too.Usually the reason is that the startup isn't doing very well. However, that judgement depends a lot on how determined the founders are.  One reason we now shy away from funding people still in school is that they often unconsciously want the startup to fail, because the idea of dropping out frightens them.A lot of startups look bad after 3 months.  Someone who's out of school and has to make it work or get a job in a cubicle will say \"don't worry, we'll figure out how to make it successful.\"', 'score': 0}   \n",

Hangul is a language that was designed by a small group of advisors when the royalty realized most koreans were illiterate (not enough resources to spend learning chinese kanji). How the hell are we supposed to be surprised that something explicitly designed to be simple, in fact, turned out to be simple? Some extra points can be deducted for the fact that they stopped using hangul for several hundred years until it was institutionalized by the strong nationalist movement post WWII and made the official writing system in an effort to establish a unique Korean culture. Additionally we can pause curiously while noting that the average Korean still uses 700-800 Chinese kanji in daily life, and that academic papers still use the kanji for particularly esoteric or complex concepts (although this is increasingly discouraged as it is viewed as elitism). He crucifies Joel and Don for using limited examples to justify a point... and then use a single example to prove his, along with unsubstantiated claims about linguistic researchers. The Japanese katakana alphabet can represent many words very well... until you try to do one with an L in it, and then it fails utterly. Using one contrived example wouldn't reveal that, and its the same reason I doubt his point about hangul.\n",
